# Gilded Rose Kata

Kata challenge attempt. Go files copied from go folder in [here](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata).

## Notes

* After some deliberation, I'm going with Table Driven Tests for the sake of simplicity, but I was thinking on separating them by product and/or Item field

## Environment

* Using WSL2 with Ubuntu
* Go version -> 1.18
